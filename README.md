# Dynamic-programming

I am taking a dynamic programming and reinforcement learning course at City University of Hong Kong as part of my data science master's program. I have a strong interest in logistics optimization, inventory management, and various optimization activities. To reinforce my learning, I review course materials using MATLAB.
