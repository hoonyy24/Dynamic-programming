# Dijkstra's algorithm

Dijkstra's algorithm, a Label Correcting Method, follows these steps: (1) Initialization: The starting node is added to the Open list with a distance of 0, while all other nodes are set to infinity (∞), and parent nodes remain undefined. (2) Selecting the shortest node: The node with the shortest distance from the Open list is selected, moved to the Closed list, and never updated again. (3) Updating distances: The selected node’s neighboring nodes are checked, and their distances are updated if a shorter path is found, updating the parent node accordingly. (4) Repeating the process: The steps continue until the Open list is empty, always selecting the shortest-distance node. (5) Determining the shortest path: Once the destination node is reached, the shortest path is reconstructed by tracing back through the parent nodes.
